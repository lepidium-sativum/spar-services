# Spar: AI Avatars â€“ Streaming UE Metahumans with custom LLM for real-time interaction

[Watch the Spar Demo Video](https://vimeo.com/1053692327/7ef043b6a9)

## Project Setup

**Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

- Create a `.env` file in each subfolder based on the provided `.env.example`.
- To populate the database initially, uncomment the code in `backend/app/dummy/mock_db_data.py`. After the initial run, comment the code again.

## Running Services

Run:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build 
```
to start the services.

**Note**: By default, this setup uses vLLM, which requires GPU support. If you're not using a GPU, disable the `vllm` service in your `docker-compose.dev.yml`.

Access applications locally at:

- Swagger API Docs: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
- Admin Panel: [http://localhost:5174](http://localhost:5174)
- Sales App: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## vLLM Configuration

Currently using the vanilla `Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct` model.

**Enabling LoRA adapters**:
- Update the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file.
- Provide a path containing `adapter_config.json` and `adapter_model.safetensors`.
